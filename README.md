* What is the Bot Hub?<br>
When you first run the program, you'll be asked if you'd like to go to the Bot Hub. It basically just shows you all of your current projects, then you can select which one you'd like to manage and it'll direct you to it's own manager page. <br>From there, you can open the project in VSC (Virtual Studio: Code), start the bot, update its' packages, and install packages.
